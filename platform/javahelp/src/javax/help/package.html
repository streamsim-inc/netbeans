Supports presentation of online documentation with both
content and contextual views of this information.
This is the main package for the JavaHelp standard extension.
The main focus of JavaHelp is online help,
but it can be used for any online content.

<p>
JavaHelp supports the notion of a HelpSet that encompases
all documentation information.
There is a simple way to read a HelpSet,
create a presentation for it, and interact with it
and there is also a collection of Swing components that
can be used directly for additional control.
JavaHelp presents content using Swing's EditorKits,
which provide for extensibility of content.
JavaHelp also provides for extensibility of context via
the notion of a NavigatorView;
several views are standard.
One of the standard views provides full-text search,
which relies on a simple search package to communicate with
search engines.


<h3>Basic Classes</h3>

<code>HelpSet</code> is the main class, providing
access to a HelpSet file.
A visual presentation of a HelpSet can be obtained through
a <code>HelpBroker</code> which is an abstraction
that permits interaction regardless of the presentation
details;
the default presentation is <code>DefaultHelpBroker</code>.
An application can provide online help using only these two classes.

<p>
Helpsets can be merged dynamically or statically, and
can be associated with Beans.

<h3>Swing components</h3>

JavaHelp provides a collection of Swing components that are used to
implement the DefaultHelpBroker and can also be used directly.  The
components follow the standard MVC from Swing.
<code>HelpModel</code> models changes to the location within a
HelpSet--components that want to respond to these changes should
listen to events originating within the model (this is how
synchronized views work).  <code>TextHelpModel</code> provides
additional information when the content is textual.
<code>DefaultHelpModel</code> is the default model that implements both
models.

<p>
<code>JHelpContentViewer</code>
is the Swing component for HTML content,
while context corresponds to several subclasses of
<code>JHelpNavigator</code>.
<code>JHelp</code> is a common grouping of these
classes into synchronized views of content.


<h3>Extensibility</h3>

Context extensibility is described through a
<code>NavigatorView</code> which provides access to context
information, plus a way of presenting this information.
<code>TOCView</code>, <code>IndexView</code>, and
<code>SearchView</code> are standard views for table of contents,
index, and full-text search.

<p>
The standard views yield standard <code>JHelpTOCNavigator</code>,
<code>JHelpIndexNavigator</code>, and
<code>JHelpSearchNavigator</code> Swing components.  The standard
views also provide access to the content--this access is
provides through subclasses
of <code>TreeItem</code>.

<p>
New views can be added,
for instance a new TOC presentation can be obtained by
subclassing TOCView and changing the JHelpNavigator
returned by it.

<h3>Context Sensitive Help</h3>

JavaHelp supports a <code>Map</code> between identifiers and URLs.
<code>FlatMap</code> and <code>TryMap</code> are two
implementations.

The main class used to associate specific content with graphic
objects is <code>CSH</code>, while <code>DialogSupport</code>
provides support in Dialogs (this may migrate to Swing at some
point).

<h3>Search</h3>
JavaHelp supports a standard full-text search view and navigator.
The view interacts with a search engine through the types in the
<code>javax.javahelp.search</code> package.  The reference
implementation provides a search engine that implements these interfaces,
but others can also be used. The specific search engine is part
of the information given to the search view.  This separation
provides the full-text search functionality but does not
imposing specific formats.
